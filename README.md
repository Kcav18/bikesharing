# Overview 

The purpose of the NYC Citibike analysis is to visualize the data to determine if Des Moines would be a good place to start a bikesharing business.

Visualizations were created in Tableau Public to show the following details:

* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results

The 7 visualizations I created are shown and discussed below.

***Viz 1: The Checkout Times for Users.*** This graph shows how many bikes were checked out and for how long. From looking at the visualization, we can see that the max bike checkout was 146,752 bikes and they were checked out for five minutes at a time.

***Viz 2: The Checkout Times by Gender.*** This graph shows the length of time that bikes were checked out for each gender. From looking at this graph, we can see that males check out the most bikes in those 5 minute intervals than females, with a max of 108,087 bikes checked out.

***Viz 3: The Trips by Weekday for Each Hour.*** This heatmap shows the number of bike trips by weekday for each of the day. We can see that the busiest bikesharing days are Thursdays between 7:00am and 9:00 am. Then it peaks again between 5pm and 6pm.

***Viz 4: Trips by Gender by Weekday per Hour.*** This heatmap shows the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week. We can see that Males check out the most bikes Monday through Friday. The peak times are still between 8am and 9am and 5pm and 6pm. Thursday seems to be the busiest day for Males using the biksharing program.

# Summary

I believe a biksharing service would be successful in Des Moines! According to a few articles I have read, Des Moines has become a hotspot for Millenials. Bikesharing services are successful in busy and poular places so this definitely seems like the place to have this service. Males will most likely be the target as they seem to be a very reliable market - especially in the standard morning and evening commute times.

Some ideas for additional analysis are shown below:

1. Analyzing the age range for the male riders. This would give a great idea of exactly what group to market to when introducing the bikesharing service in Des Moines. Marketing efforts geared towards increasing female rides should be done as well- but to get started, knowing the age range of typical male riders could be very beneficial. 

2. Analyzing how many of the riders are residents of NYC vs. how many are tourists. If the majority of riders in NYC are tourists, we would need to analyze how many tourists Des Moines has annually because that could greatly impact the success of the business.
